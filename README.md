DriveX is a  mobile app designed for convenient short term car rentals, a hassle-free way to rent cars directly from owners. Users can easily find the perfect car, communicate with the owner, and even capture pre-rental and post-rental pictures, all within the app. It streamlines the rental process, allowing renters to pick a location, book, and manage
everything seamlessly through the platform.


_**Key features:**_

1. Database: Car Listings and Reservations
    The app stores information on available cars, including model, pricing, and location. Additionally, the database records car reservations, including reservation details such as the 
    specified date, time, pickup, and drop-off locations.

2. Location Services:
    The app utilizes location services to display a map with nearby car rental locations. Users can see the exact location of their reserved car and the nearest pickup points.

3. Camera Integration:
    The app enables users to capture and store photos of rental cars using an internet connection. This feature allows users to record the car's condition for transparency during 
    pickup and drop-off, with the photos being securely stored in the database, accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.
